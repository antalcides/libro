\begin{abstract}
This document demonstrates the use of many features which are likely to be useful in preparing \LaTeX\ documents.  There are sections demonstrating basic text, math, code, and images (both internally and externally produced).  I also throw in little features such as \textbf{bold} and \textit{italic} sections, which you can find the code for within the \TeX\ file.  If there are things that you would like to see added, let me know.  This is just a quick collection of features I thought to throw together in an evening.  Of course, there are any number of websites (and presumably books, but who are we kidding) which go through this same material and heaps more.  This document merely attempts to demonstrate how many of the common features available in this typesetting environment may be applied in context.  For the full range of capabilities, I highly recommend using online resources which include the complete documentation for these commands.  Whenever I introduce a new feature, though, I include a section in blue which demonstrates the code used to produce the output in question.  If you are completely new to \LaTeX , you will want to download some software to begin.  I use \textbf{TeXworks}, but that is only one of many options out there.  Many have a stronger UI than mine, and the most bare-bones versions have no GUI.

% Packages

The following code is sufficient to produce a basic document.  In the preamble, it defines the type of document being created (\emph{documentclass}), any special packages that might be required to compile the document (\emph{usepackage}), as well as a statement of the title and author of the work.  As I introduce more sophisticated capabilities of the software, I will also discuss more packages and settings that can be called in the preamble when they are needed.  

At the end of the preamble, the command, \lstinline!\begin{document}!, begins the main body.  After this command, I tell the software to include a title, table of contents, and an abstract.  I then insert the main text, and finally call a bibliography using references written to the file, \emph{BiblioTemp.bib}.  The command, \lstinline!\end{document}! ends the document.  After saving, I typically run three commands in my compiler to prepare the document and ensure that all of the auxiliary files have been properly updated.  These three commands are \emph{pdfLaTeX}, \emph{MakeIndex}, and \emph{BibTeX}.  It is generally not necessary to run all three, but as it it better than spending hours on end trying to figure out why your document is not compiling properly, only to find out that your \emph{*.bbl} file was out of date.

\subsection{Text}\label{text}

Basic text is pretty easy.  Just define your document class, open your document, and start typing, maybe adding a chapter or section along the way.  However that's pretty boring, especially if you're not an English major and have to use things like, \emph{you know}, \textbf{MATH}.  Let's look at some of the options\dots\footnote{I want to quickly point out a few features that can drive someone crazy if they are not paying attention.  Many symbols, such as \&, \textasciitilde, and \textbackslash\ require special notation in \LaTeX , since the symbols themselves have certain meaning in the software.  Make sure you proofread your finished document--esp. where you are likely to use symbols--to ensure that there are no odd missing items or strange additions.}  

In the previous paragraph, we saw features like italics and bold face type, as well as an ellipsis and a footnote.  These are typeset as,

\subsection{References}

\begin{lstlisting}
\subsection{References}
\end{lstlisting}

In many instances, you want to refer to something that is in a different section of your document or even in a different document.  To do the former, you need only label your sections, equations, theorems, \&c. as you go along, just as I did here in Section \ref{text}.  By default, numbers are used to reference items, with a unique counter for each environment (sections, equations, \&c.), but there are ways to change that.  In sections \ref{theorem} and \ref{math}, I mention \emph{counter} tools and the \emph{tag} feature.  

\begin{lstlisting}
...label your sections, equations, theorems, \&c. as you go along, just as I did here in Section \ref{text}...
\end{lstlisting}

And of course there is the question of references to other works.  The most useful commands for that are \emph{cite} and \emph{citep} \citep{Lewis14} (Ignore the fact that I'm citing myself to back up this claim).  The bibliography style I use here is \emph{JPE} and I compile my references using $\mathrm{B{\scriptstyle{IB}}}$\TeX.  Of course, different journals and subfields may prefer different formats from these presented here, but hopefully this will get you off the ground.  

\begin{lstlisting}

\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}
...I compile my references using $\mathrm{B{\scriptstyle{IB}}}$\TeX...
\end{lstlisting}

When referencing you bibliography, the program will skip over citations if it they cannot be found in a \emph{*.bib} file (that has also been appropriately compiled using $\mathrm{B{\scriptstyle{IB}}}$\TeX).  If this happens, you will receive a question mark in lieu of the citation.  Luckily, the \emph{*.bib} file is easy to assemble, since it is little more than a list of all your sources:  

\begin{lstlisting}
@ARTICLE{Lewis14,
   AUTHOR  = {Lewis, Darl},
   TITLE   = {A \LaTeX Template},  
   YEAR    = {2014},
   JOURNAL = {A Journal},
   VOLUME  = {1},
   NUMBER  = {1},
   PAGES   = {1-12}
}
%
@BOOK{Lewis14a,
   AUTHOR  = {Lewis, Darl},
   TITLE   = {A \LaTeX Book},  
   YEAR    = {2014},
   PUBLISHER = {My Computer},
   ADDRESS  = {NJ},
}
%
@INCOLLECTION{Lewis14b,
   AUTHOR  = {Lewis, Darl},
   TITLE   = {Another \LaTeX Template},  
   YEAR    = {2014},
   EDITOR = {Lewis, Darl},
   BOOKTITLE  = {Another \LaTeX Book},
   PUBLISHER = {My Computer},
   ADDRESS  = {NJ},
}
\end{lstlisting}

To insert the list of references at the end of your document, simply define the bibliography style and call the bibliography before you end the document.  The \emph{nocite} option allow the software to include references in the works cited section whether or not thay have been cited within the document.  

\begin{lstlisting}
\bibliographystyle{jpe}
\nocite{*}
\bibliography{BiblioTemp}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Theorems, \&c.}\label{theorem}

There are a few environments readily available for writing theorems and proofs and the like, but sometimes you have to define your own.  Luckily, that's easy to do.  In the preamble of my document, I have defined four environments, \emph{Theorem}, \emph{Definition}, \emph{Proposition}, and \emph{Corollary}, using these commands: 

\begin{lstlisting}
\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}
\newtheorem{definition}{Definition}
\newtheorem{proposition}{Proposition}
\newtheorem{corollary}{Corollary}
\end{lstlisting}

\LaTeX\ counts each environment separately unless specified otherwise using any of the \emph{counter} tools such as \emph{addtocounter} and \emph{newcounter}.  



\begin{theorem}
All governments are unjust.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Consider an arbitrary government. Since it is arbitrary, it is obviously unjust.  The assertion being correct for an arbitrary government, it is thus true for all governments.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Math}\label{math}

The value of \LaTeX\ becomes most apparent when writing equations.  After a while, it becomes very easy to simply type equations as you go in a way that does not accrue with many other software platforms.  Most mathematical symbols are simply a \textbackslash\ followed by the name of the symbol, and most of the common structures you are likely to encounter are designed to be implemented with relative ease and flexibility.  If you want to write an inline equation, just use the \$ like this $a+b=c$.  

\begin{lstlisting}
...If you want to write an inline equation, just use the \$ like this $a+b=c$.
\end{lstlisting}

If you want to to write something longer or make it more visible by pulling it out of the text, though, use the \emph{equation} environment:

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{e}^{i\pi}+1=0
\end{equation}

\begin{lstlisting}
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{e}^{i\pi}+1=0
\end{equation}
\end{lstlisting}

If you don't want to attach a number, there are several options.  I usually just go with this one...

\[
\rho\left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t}+\mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla\mathbf{v}\right)=-\nabla p+\nabla\cdot\mathbf{T}+f
\]

\begin{lstlisting}
\[
\rho\left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t}+\mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla\mathbf{v}\right)=-\nabla p+\nabla\cdot\mathbf{T}+f
\]
\end{lstlisting}

And of course, if you want to name a multiline equation,

\begin{equation}\tag{Bad Math}
\begin{split}
a+b&=c \\
2(a+b)-(a+b)&=2c-c \\
2a+2b-2c&=a+b-c \\
2(a+b-c)&=a+b-c \\
2&=1
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\begin{lstlisting}
\begin{equation}\tag{Bad Math}
\begin{split}
a+b&=c \\
2(a+b)-(a+b)&=2c-c \\
2a+2b-2c&=a+b-c \\
2(a+b-c)&=a+b-c \\
2&=1
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{lstlisting}

Note the use of the \emph{split} environment and the \& to align equations in this system.  

There are other ways of separating an equation into multiple lines with slightly varying effects.  These include, \emph{multline}, \emph{align}, \emph{gather}, and \emph{eqnarray}, among others.  

Sometimes you may want to nest a few related equations under one number.  Try this:

\begin{subequations}\label{mygrp}
\begin{align}
a+b&=c \label{firstgrp}\\
c&=d+e \\
d&=f+g \\
e&=h+i 
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

\begin{lstlisting}
\begin{subequations}\label{mygrp}
\begin{align}
a+b&=c \label{firstgrp}\\
c&=d+e \\
d&=f+g \\
e&=h+i 
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
\end{lstlisting}

If you label them properly, you can easily refer back to previous equations like \eqref{mygrp}.  That makes it easy to talk about how similar \eqref{firstgrp} is to the first equation I presented here in Section \ref{math}.

\begin{lstlisting}
If you label them properly, you can easily refer back to previous equations like \eqref{mygrp}.
\end{lstlisting}

For more on mathematical features and symbols, I will refer you to a well-written document in \cite{Downes02}, which offers a quick run-down of the capabilities of the software.  For a comprehensive list of symbols available, both in the equation environment and the text environment, see \cite{Pakin09}.  



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



\subsection{Code}

Sometimes you may want to put code directly into your document.  The easiest way is with the \emph{verbatim} package, something you will see in several of the images that come later in this document.  

\begin{verbatim}
% Don't do this!
i=1
while i>0
    	i++
end;
\end{verbatim}

\begin{lstlisting}
\begin{verbatim}
% Don't do this!
i=1
while i>0
    	i++
end;
\end{verbatim}
\end{lstlisting}

Of course, with \emph{verbatim}, you're not restricted to writing code.  Any text is fine as long as you're willing to live with that plain ASCII feel.  On the other hand, if you are looking for something more sophisticated to insert plain text or code, as I have been doing throughout this document, you may prefer to use the more-versatile \emph{listings} package, which has been explicitly designed for inserting code into \LaTeX\ files.  To implement that package, simply replace the word, \emph{verbatim}, in the previous block of code with the word, \emph{lstlisting}.  Throughout this document, I have use the following settings, defined in the preamble:

\begin{lstlisting}
\lstset{breaklines=true, backgroundcolor=\color{blue!10},language=,breakindent=0pt}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Tables}

Tables in \LaTeX, like everything else, take some getting used to, but they can come out very nicely once you've taken the time to assemble them.  Many statistical packages (including \textbf{Stata} and \textbf{R}) also offer macros which will output data in \LaTeX\ format to save you the trouble.  By default, the software places tables where they best fit in the text, which is not always precisely where they are written in the source.

\begin{table}\caption{The auto data\label{auto}}

\begin{tabular}{l*{2}{rr}}

That table wasn't very complicated.  Let's look at some other features now which add a little fun to to the process.  Here I am going to write a table which has been turned sideways (ostensibly because it fits better in landscape mode) using the \emph{rotating} package.  To avoid interfering with the surrounding text, this table is placed at the end of the document.  Rewriting this second table for statistical data would not be a challenging task.

Here is an image with a caption included using the \emph{graphicx} package.  I have placed it inside a figure to make manipulation easier (i.e. placement within the paper, centering, \&c).

\subsection{Drawing in \LaTeX}
Of course, sometimes you don't have a preexisting picture and want to draw one yourself.  Here are a few ways you can do that using the \emph{TikZ} package.  I start with some that will probably be more useful and move up to a couple of much more complicated diagrams.  Of course there are many more options out there if you search for \emph{TikZ} examples.  Look at \cite{Cremer11} to start.

\subsubsection{The Prisoner's Dilemma}

As a basis for measuring the capabilities of \emph{TikZ}, here is a replication of the game as it was presented in the last example of the previous section.  To complete this graphic, I have loaded three libraries in the preamble:  \\

\subsubsection{Mindmap and Layers}
Finally, this complicated diagram is useful for visualizing the relationship between divergent concepts.  It also looks really cool.  It uses the \emph{times} package in addition to \emph{TikZ} and the \emph{TikZ} libraries, \emph{mindmap} and \emph{backgrounds}.

\section{Conclusion}
Now that you have made it this far, it is time to just jump in and start playing around with the software.  Practice makes perfect, right?  If you have more requests for information to include, let me know.  I will try to update this document over time to add functionality as well as make the learning experience easier.  Hopefully there is enough here to at least give you an idea of what to look for as you attempt to write documents in \LaTeX.
